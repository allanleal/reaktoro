# Step 1: Import the reaktoro Python package
from reaktoro import *

# Step 2: Initialize a thermodynamic database
db = Database('supcrt98.xml')

# Step 3: Define the chemical system
editor = ChemicalEditor(db)
editor.addAqueousPhase('H O Na Cl C')
editor.addGaseousPhase(['CO2(g)'])

# Step 4: Construct the chemical system
system = ChemicalSystem(editor)

# Step 5: Define the chemical equilibrium problem
problem = EquilibriumProblem(system)
problem.setTemperature(60, 'celsius')
problem.setPressure(100, 'bar')
problem.add('H2O', 1.0, 'kg')
problem.add('NaCl', 1.0, 'mol')
problem.add('CO2', 10.0, 'mol')

# Step 6: Calculate the chemical equilibrium state
state = equilibrate(problem)

# Step 7: Output the calculated chemical state to a file
state.output('result.txt')

# Step 8: Print the amounts of some aqueous species
print('Amount of CO2(aq):', state.speciesAmount('CO2(aq)'))
print('Amount of HCO3-:', state.speciesAmount('HCO3-'))
print('Amount of CO3--:', state.speciesAmount('CO3--'))

# Step 9: Print the amounts of element C in both aqueous and gaseous phases
print('Amount of C in aqueous phase:', state.elementAmountInPhase('C', 'Aqueous'))
print('Amount of C in gaseous phase:', state.elementAmountInPhase('C', 'Gaseous'))
