/// The base type for the primary activity and corrective thermodynamic
/// properties of a phase. Thermodynamic properties for a phase, such as
/// internal energy, enthalpy, Gibbs energy, entropy, and volume can be broken
/// down into *ideal* and *corrective* contributions. Let us denote by @eq{M}
/// one of these properties. The previous statement implies that:
///
/// @eqc{M=\sum_{i=1}^{\mathrm{N}}x_{i}M_{i}^{\circ}+M^{\mathrm{x}},}
///
/// with the first term being the *ideal contribution* and the second term,
/// @eq{M^{\mathrm{x}}}, being the *corrective contribution*, where @eq{x_{i}}
/// and @eq{M_{i}^{\circ}} are, respectively, the mole fraction and respective
/// standard molar property of the \eq{i}-th species in the phase.
///
/// Thus, corrective thermodynamic properties are those that need to be added
/// to their ideal counterpart to obtain more correct values that take into
/// account the non-ideal thermodynamic behavior of phases. The word
/// *corrective* is adopted in %Reaktoro to mean either *excess* or *residual*
/// properties.
///
/// @note The corrective property \eq{M^{\mathrm{x}}} may sometimes be the
/// *actual complete property* of the phase, i.e., \eq{M^{\mathrm{x}} \equiv
/// M}. For example, for gaseous phases in which the partial molar volumes of
/// the species are conventionally zero, @eq{V_{i}^{\circ}=0}, the corrective
/// molar volume, @eq{V^{\mathrm{x}}}, must be set as the total molar volume of
/// the phase. @see ActivityModel, ActivityArgs
