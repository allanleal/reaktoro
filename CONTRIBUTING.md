Contributing
------------

Reaktoro is an open-source project and **we need your help** to make it even more successful.

You can contribute to the project in many ways: 
- by reporting bugs ([read more](#reporting-bugs))
- by proposing new features ([read more](#proposing-new-features))
- by performing benchmark calculations ([read more](#performing-benchmark-calculations))
- by contributing with documentation and examples ([read more](#contributing-with-documentation-and-examples))
- by contributing with development ([read more](#contributing-with-development)).

## Reporting bugs

You got a bug and this is frustrating, we understand you. But don't worry - we'll be happy to fix it for you (*provided it is indeed a bug!*).

To report a bug, please go to [Reaktoro's GitHub Issues][github-issues] and enter a *descriptive title* and *write your issue with enough details*. On the right side of the page, click on *Labels* and choose **bug**.

Again, we understand your frustration, but we would appreciate if you are kind to us when reporting your issue.

Have you heard about a [**Minimum Reproducible Example**][minimum-reproducible-example]? Please provide such an example so that we can be more efficient in identifying the bug and fixing it for you.

Have you heard about [**Markdown**][mastering-markdown]? Please use Markdown syntax when writing your issues.

## Proposing new features

You have the feeling that Reaktoro could be extended with a few more methods and classes, or some new types of calculations or modeling capabilities. Great, let us know what you think it is missing and we'll do our best to get it implemented. Understand, however, that we have limited resources, and some new features could be more difficult to be implemented.

Anyway, to tell us what you would like to get developed, please go to [Reaktoro's GitHub Issues][github-issues] and describe there your desired new feature. Please choose the **enhancement** label for this issue on the right side of the issues page.

## Performing benchmark calculations

You have used Reaktoro to perform some calculations for which you have experimental data (or you have performed similar calculations using other codes). **We would be very excited if you could share with us your results!** And if the results you obtained with Reaktoro are not great, please make sure we know about this and we'll be very happy to help you making your calculations more accurate. 

Get in touch with us by going to [Reaktoro's GitHub Issues][github-issues] and telling us what you want to share.
